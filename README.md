# Win10-_AddWiFi
Force PC onto given SSID network automatically. Can deploy to 1 or 100's of windows 10/11 devices in the background without end user(s) knowing.
It also may be a good idea to modify the script to not hard code your own password in, but prompt for your own input. As of now it seems to delete the tmp file fine. Use at your own risk.
